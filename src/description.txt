This is an old Java game I wrote in 2019.

We're looking to improve the code quality and add features that were never finished.
The end result should implement all the mechanics necessary for a Zelda-type game.


Player Controls -
        Add blocking and other moves
        W/S = forward backwards
        A/D = rotates character
        Escape accesses inventory
        Add inventory management

NPCs -
        Different types of NPC
        Idle unless provoked
        Have a random dialogue
        Shows health bar
        Can drop points/weapons if killed
        Add buy/sell from NPCs


Multiple levels -
        Node-based system of connecting rooms (as opposed to the previous grid-based system)
        Scrolling screen on larger rooms
        Game over screen when player dies
        Fade in/fade out on level transition
